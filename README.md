For this project, I used Python to conduct a sales analysis on a dataset containing information about a company's sales over a period of time. The objective of the analysis was to identify insights that could help the company improve its sales performance and make better business decisions.

To begin, I combined monthly data and then cleaned and preprocessed the data, removing missing values and adding new columns where necessary. I then utilized various data visualization techniques to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

Through the analysis, I discovered several interesting findings. For instance, I determined which month and city generated the most sales, what the optimal time was to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers making a purchase, which products were most frequently sold together, and which product was the best-selling.
